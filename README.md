# wmx2obj

## Summary

wmx2obj is a reverse engineering conversion tool for Final Fantasy 8. It converts the world map file of Final Fantasy 8 into known Wavefront .obj format â€” thus making it possible to import the world map geometry into Blender, for instance.

wmx2obj is written in Java. JavaFX is used for graphics display purposes.

## Instructions

- Build and run the solution.
- Select which segments of the world map should be included in the Wavefront file. Or, leave the settings untouched to convert the whole world map.
- Import the original Final Fantasy 8 world map file wmx.obj.
- Push the export button to choose a save location and generate the converted file.
- Import the converted file into your 3D graphics program of choice (e.g. Blender).
